# QonnectR

**QonnectR** is a platform designed to simplify networking and project collaboration through QR code identification. It bridges the gap between the technical and non-technical communities, making it easier to find like-minded individuals and share ideas without the noise typically found on platforms like LinkedIn or GitHub.

## What Are We Solving?

We address the challenge of forgotten interactions, difficulty in finding collaborators, and the need for a simple, efficient way to connect using QR codes. Traditional networking platforms often feel cluttered, while GitHub is geared towards developers, making it less accessible to those outside the tech field. QonnectR provides an easy way to showcase ideas and collaborate with a simple QR code scan.

## Why Use QonnectR Over LinkedIn/GitHub?

Unlike LinkedIn and GitHub, QonnectR is designed to cater to both technical and non-technical users. It's not about job hunting or showing off skills—it's about connecting individuals with innovative ideas. The QR code integration makes networking seamless, allowing users to share their profiles effortlessly, even with just a quick scan at a coffee chat or event. This approach is simple, accessible, and effective.

## What Makes QonnectR Unique?

While QR codes are ubiquitous in daily life (e.g., in ads, menus, and forms), other platforms don't make it as easy to use QR codes for networking. QonnectR generates personalized QR codes linked to unique profiles, making professional connections and collaboration quicker than ever.

## Key Features

- **QR Code Profile Generation**: Instantly generate a QR code for your personalized profile.
- **Profile Search**: Find users based on interests and project ideas with a working search engine.
- **Effortless Networking**: Scan a QR code to access someone's profile with all relevant information.

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges:
- Integrating **Auth0** with an **Express server** for secure authentication.
- Using the **Auth0 management API** to handle user sign-up on the backend instead of a pop-up.
- Configuring **AWS S3 bucket policies** for profile picture storage.
- Integrating **Auth0 tokens** with **Firebase** for user attribute management.

### Non-Technical Challenges:
- Deciding what essential information should be displayed in the profiles.
- Learning how to make the connecting process easier, quicker, yet still convenient.
- Ensuring the platform is accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Future Enhancements

To take it a step further, we plan to integrate the **Apple Developer Pass Kit**, allowing users to store their QR codes directly in Apple Wallet. We also aim to add a **certifications upload system**, where users can showcase their resumes or certificates to highlight their achievements. Adding options for users to follow and message others will also improve the overall experience.

## Scenario

Imagine you're someone with great project ideas but hesitant to use LinkedIn, as it feels like a platform for job hunters. With QonnectR, you can connect with people who share your passion and collaborate on projects without feeling like you need help finishing your work. Just scan a QR code, view profiles, and start networking effortlessly.
